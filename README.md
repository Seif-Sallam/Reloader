# Reloader

Reloader is a game that is made with "Realistic" shooting mechanics. There is a game on Steam that is called "Reloader Test_Subject". Yes this is basically me challenging myself to make the game since I thought, it would actually be possible to create that mechanic in a not so long time. The hard part would be the art, the graphics, and making the game optimized. (The original game is not optimized at all.
